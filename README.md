# BurgerAPP

This App is a simulation of a fast food shop, with 3 fully customisable meal options, basic burger + additionals, 
healthy burger + more additionals and deluxe burger package, which includes chips and drink, and it's possible to choose 3 different sizes of these.
The three types of meals are built using three classes, 2 extending from basic hamburger class, encapsulating instance variables and overriding some methods.
